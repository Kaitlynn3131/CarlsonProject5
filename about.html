            <h3>About Kaitlynn's Fixing Company:</h3>
                <p>This company I created because I love helping others and working with technology. Owning this business allows me to help those who are having technology issues. I have had this thought for so long and finally decide to do it. I graduated college with a Bachlor of Science degree in Comput Science and worked in IT support/helpdesk at a company for last few years. This is a newer company, so we are still trying to get the hang of things but we look forward to working with everyone and helping you with your technology issues. Thank you for choosing Kaitlynn's Fixing Company!
            -The Owner Kaitlynn Carlson</p>
